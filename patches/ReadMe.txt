Civ278.zip and CivMGE.zip .txt file
These up dates are meant for those of us looking to have the most updated 
files for our game. These files are meant for those of us owning a copy of 
Civilization II, Classic or MGE, not a warez version. This is the first 
version of the necessary files to update your civ to "classic" 2.7.8 or 
"mge" 1.3 and as such may cause errors so back up all files which will be changed. Remember Civilization II is trademarked/copyrighted/reserved to Microprose (now owned by Infogrames) and is NOT free for download.

Now you may ask "Why have a 2.7.8 update if its included in MGE?" Well a 
couple reasons actually. First of all MGE requires that there be A Civ cd in 
the CD-rom drive, though it does not care which, and I have heard that the 
scenario creation tools are better in 2.7.8.

Which version should you download? That is up to you. If you have enough 
space on your computer then I would say both, install civ in 2 different 
directories. I myself have Civ II 2.42 Civ II 2.78 and Civ II MGE 1.3 on 
my computer. If you are limited on space I would recommend going with what 
the people you play games with use, so that your versions are compatible for 
say sucession games. If you really want my opinion I would say MGE as it is 
multiplayer.

This is release version Beta 1.0
